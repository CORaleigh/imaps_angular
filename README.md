# iMAPS v4.0.0
New version of iMAPS developed with Angular 7.x, Angular Material, and ArcGIS JavaScript API 4.x.

## Whats New?

Layers now all feature layers, rather than map image services.  Faster drawing, added to map as SVG, sharper graphics and labels.

Can now pull in layers from different sources, including local munipalities and ArcGIS Online.

JavaScript API 4.x enables the use of WebGL rendering.

Layers now grouped into categories and subcategories.

Long click or long touch to select a property, no need to open select tool

Property info now grouped in cards, rather than long list

Photos and deeds now integrated into property info.

Streetview removed, now can be accessed in property info.

Tools no longer crammed in corner, there is now a tool side panel

Better support for mobile devices.
